# This is a simple program to calculate a user's age category based on their input.
# It contains a few bugs that need to be fixed.


# Function to determine the age category
def get_age_category(age):
  # Bug 1: Incorrect comparison operator.
  # The program should check if age is a valid number.
  if not 120 > age > 0:

  # Bug 2: Incorrect logic in if-elif-else statements.
  # The conditions are overlapping and will cause issues.
